# Chain Simulation
 A simple proof of concept program I wrote some time ago that simulates chains.


## How to use it:

Left click to add a node.

Connect two nodes by holding left click and dragging the mouse from one node to another.

Pin a node by single clicking on an existing one. This prevents it from moving.

Click the Simulate button to run the simulation of the chain.
